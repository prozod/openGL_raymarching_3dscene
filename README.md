# C++/OpenGL Basic 3D Scene (Raymarching/Signed Distance Functions)

A simple 3D scene/plane where I make use of fragment shaders to implement different objects iteratively (I believe this is called *raymarching*), using Signed Distance Functions, then cast a light (Phong) over them and add shadows.

The scene is a bit laggy when the shadows are on, I feel like the way I compute the rays hitting objects is not correct.
